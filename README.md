# Portfolio

## User Story

As a web developer, I want a deployed portfolio, so that I can showcase my applications to potential employers and clients.


## Business Context

A Portfolio is often the first point of contact for employers looking to fill a position or clients in need of a developer to complete a project.  A clean and informative portfolio showcases a developer's strongest work and can lead to employment and/or more clients.

## Acceptance Criteria

Given that an employer or client wants to hire a developer when viewing their portfolio, then they are able to learn about the developer, find contact information, and follow links to projects and respositories.
