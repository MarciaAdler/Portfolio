                My name is Marcia Adler.  I am a former consultant who is looking to make a career change into tech. I am learning to code so I can become a softtware engineer and work on projects that help bring companies visions to life.

                Prior to attending the Columbia Engineering Coding Bootcamp, I worked as a consultant in the area of human capital, working on transformatons and M&A projects.  I worked for a large consulting firm, as well as an internal consultant for a globla organization.

                I enjoy solving problems and working with others to help organization achieve their goals.  Once I graduate I would like to work for an organization, helping bring their vision to life, using the technology skills I have gained in the Bootcamp.
