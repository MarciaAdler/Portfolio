                When I'm not working or studying, I have a cat at home, named Princess, who is the sweetest thing.  I also love spending time with my family and friends.  I also love to travel and explore new places.  I have spent time living in Spain, Costa Rica and Hawaii.  I have also traveled to several other states and countries for both pleasure and work.  During my time as a consultant, I traveled to Germany and Canada, as well as to several different states in the US for work.
